The Chinese lunar New Year is a traditional festival which has a long history for thousands of years. It's the most important festival for Chinese people. For us, the lunar New Year is the real New Year. The western New Year, also known as the Public New Year, which was introduced by the Republic of China and promoted by that government. We so glad that because it has a day off on Public New Year's Day. Of course, the Chinese lunar New Year is an even greater weight for Chinese people, because, at this time of the year, people who work outside will go home, reunite with their families and meet relatives and friends. During the Spring Festival, it usually takes a week off. It's difficult to imagine that such a large country like China will suspend most of its work except for special defense-like tasks and return home for the New Year collectively. This is also a major feature of China.
