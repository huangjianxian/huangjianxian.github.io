U.S. President Trump called on his followers to gather in Congress on January 6, 2021, because he suspects that Democrats have stolen his election results. On that day, his followers really arrived at Congress. They stormed and entered the Congress Hall, disrupted the order, and a large number of documents were scattered on the scene. Someone sitting in Pelosi's office chair to take a photo, this is undoubtedly a major event in the United States.<!--more-->

After that, Twitter permanently banned President Trump's account, which once again proved hypocritical for the "freedom of speech" that Western countries have been using to brainwash other countries. The sentence we heard since childhood, "I disagree with your point of view, but I swear to defend your right to speak" has also become a joke in the United States.

The reason given by Twitter is to incite violence, which is undoubtedly extremely ridiculous. In 2019, riots broke out in Hong Kong. The United States called it a beautiful landscape. When the same thing happened in the US, they called it riots and thugs. Such a shameless double standard. It proves once again that the big social platforms in the US have been completely controlled by big Western capital interest groups. The so-called truth, justice, etc. are all hypocritical words, and only the interests behind them are really concerned.

Seeing that Trump will step down in a few days, many people have turned against Trump. Cabinet members have resigned. Trump has been emptied and lost the media. It is difficult to imagine how lost he is now. 

This series of events has proved that the social division in the United States is intensifying, which has also accelerated the decline of the US.
